```{r setup, include=FALSE}
options(htmltools.dir.version = FALSE)
```

```{r xaringanthemer, include = FALSE}

xaringanthemer::style_mono_accent(
  base_color = "#A70000",

## the survey dataset

+ One row per individual

<center>
```{r columns, echo = FALSE, out.width = 500}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/columns.png")
```


---
## downloading the dataset

We are going to download the file to our `data_raw` sub folder: 

```{r, eval = FALSE}

download.file(url = "https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292169",
              destfile = "data_raw/portal_data_joined.csv")
```

We can read it using function `read.csv()`

```{r}
surveys <- read.csv("data_raw/portal_data_joined.csv")
```

 <!-- mostrar el help de read.csv - un equivalente sería surveys <- read.table(file="data_raw/portal_data_joined.csv", sep=",", header=TRUE) --> 

---
## reading files into R

Functions to read data are key to any project.   
for dataframes: `read.csv()`, `read.delim()`

```{r}
surveys <- read.csv("data_raw/portal_data_joined.csv")
surveys_check <- read.table(file = "data_raw/portal_data_joined.csv", 
                            sep = ",", 
                            header = TRUE)
identical(surveys, surveys_check)
```

There are __many other ways__ to read data into R, some are specific for the type of data (GIS shapefiles or raster, and specific packages may come with their own reader functions)


```{r try, echo = FALSE, eval=FALSE}
surveys
View(surveys)
head(surveys)
str(surveys)
dim(surveys)
nrow(surveys)
ncol(surveys)
head(surveys) # 6 rows by default
tail(surveys)
names(surveys)
rownames(surveys)
str(surveys)
summary(surveys)
length(surveys) # number of columns 
```


---
## inspecting `data.frame` objects

Based on the output of `str(surveys)`, can you answer the following questions?

+ What is the class of the object surveys?

+ How many rows and how many columns are in this object?

+ How many species have been recorded during these surveys?

--

  + `data.frame`

--

  + 34786 rows and 13 columns

--

  + Number of species?

```{r challenge, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE, purl=TRUE}
unique(surveys$species)
unique(surveys$species_id) # we dont know what this code is about
```

---
## indexing and subsetting data frames

+ a vector has only one dimension, so:

  + `length()` refers to number of __elements__
  + `dim()` 
  + selection between brackets `[]`

--

+ a data.frame has __two__ dimensions, so `dim()`, `ncol()`, `nrow()` and selection between brackets `[]` BUT with the two dimensions separated by a comma: `[rows, columns]`

---
## indexing and subsetting data frames

<small>
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# first element in the first column of the data frame (as a vector)

# first element in the 6th column (as a vector)

# first column of the data frame (as a vector)

# first column of the data frame (as a data.frame)

# first three elements in the 7th column (as a vector)

# the 3rd row of the data frame (as a data.frame)

# equivalent to head_surveys <- head(surveys)

```

---
## indexing and subsetting data frames

<small>
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# first element in the first column of the data frame (as a vector)
surveys[1, 1]   
# first element in the 6th column (as a vector)
surveys[1, 6]   
# first column of the data frame (as a vector)
surveys[, 1]    
# first column of the data frame (as a data.frame)
surveys[1]      
# first three elements in the 7th column (as a vector)
surveys[1:3, 7] 
# the 3rd row of the data frame (as a data.frame)
surveys[3, ]    
# equivalent to head_surveys <- head(surveys)
head_surveys <- surveys[1:6, ] 
```


---
## indexing and subsetting data frames

+ minus sign to __remove__ the indexed column or row

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# The whole data frame, except the first column
surveys[, -1]          
surveys[-(7:34786), ] # Equivalent to head(surveys)
```

---
## subsetting by name

```{r subset, eval = FALSE}
  surveys["species_id"]       # Result is a data.frame
* surveys[, "species_id"]     # Result is a vector
  surveys[["species_id"]]     # Result is a vector
* surveys$species_id          # Result is a vector
```

+ R has several ways to do some things

---
## challenge

<small>

+ Create a data.frame (`surveys_200`) containing only the data in row 200 of the `surveys` dataset

+ Notice how `nrow()` gave you the number of rows in a data.frame? Use that number to pull out just that last row in the data frame

+ Compare that with what you see as the last row using `tail()` to make sure it’s meeting expectations

+ Pull out that last row using `nrow()` instead of the row number.

+ Create a new data frame (`surveys_last`) from that last row.

+ Use `nrow()` to extract the row that is in the middle of the data frame. Store the content of this row in an object named `surveys_middle`.

+ Combine `nrow()` with the - notation above to reproduce the behavior of `head(surveys)`, keeping just the first through 6th rows of the surveys dataset.

</small>

```{r challenge2, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
# Create a data.frame (`surveys_200`) containing only the data in row 200 of the `surveys` dataset

# Notice how `nrow()` gave you the number of rows in a data.frame? Use that number to pull out just that last row in the data frame

# Compare that with what you see as the last row using `tail()` to make sure it’s meeting expectations

# Pull out that last row using `nrow()` instead of the row number.

# Create a new data frame (`surveys_last`) from that last row.

# Use `nrow()` to extract the row that is in the middle of the data frame. Store the content of this row in an object named `surveys_middle`.

# Combine `nrow()` with the - notation above to reproduce the behavior of `head(surveys)`, keeping just the first through 6th rows of the surveys dataset.

```

## factors

+ __factors__: vectors (one-dimensional) representing __categorical variables__ and thus having __levels__. ordered or unordered (`c(“low”, “medium”, “high”)`

+ R < 4.0 had a default behavior `stringsAsFactors = TRUE` so any character column was transformed into a factor 

```r
`?read.csv()`
?default.stringsAsFactors
```

## today if we want factors we have to transform the vectors

---
## factors

<small>
```{r eval = FALSE, echo= TRUE}
## Compare the difference between our data read as
#`factor` vs `character`.
surveys <- read.csv("data_raw/portal_data_joined.csv",
                    stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
str(surveys)
surveys <- read.csv("data_raw/portal_data_joined.csv",
                    stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
str(surveys)
## Convert the column "plot_type" and sex into a factor
surveys$plot_type <- factor(surveys$plot_type)
surveys$sex <- factor(surveys$sex)
```

---
## working with factors

<small>
```{r remedy001, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
sex <- factor(c("male", "female", "female", "male"))
levels(sex) # in alphabetical order!
nlevels(sex) 
sex
sex <- factor(sex, levels = c("male", "female"))
sex # after re-ordering
as.character(sex)

year_fct <- factor(c(1990, 1983, 1977, 1998, 1990))
as.numeric(year_fct)               # Wrong! And there is no warning...
as.numeric(as.character(year_fct)) # Works...
as.numeric(levels(year_fct))
as.numeric(levels(year_fct))[year_fct]    # The recommended way.
```

---
## let's make a plot of a factor variable

`plot(as.factor(surveys$sex))`

.pull-right[let's rename this label]

```{r plot, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
plot(as.factor(surveys$sex))
#take the variable out
sex <- factor(surveys$sex) 
#head(sex, n = 6)
#levels(sex)
levels(sex)[1] <- "undetermined"
#levels(sex)
#head(sex) # hasta aquí con ellos
```

---
## let's make a plot of a factor variable

`plot(sex)`

.pull-right[let's rename this label]

```{r plot2, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
plot(sex)
```


---
## challenge

<small>

.pull-left[
```{r remedy003, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
levels(sex)[2] <- "female"
levels(sex)[3] <- "male"
sex <- factor(sex, levels = c("female", "male", "undetermined"))
plot(as.factor(sex))
```
]

.pull-right[

+ Rename “F” and “M” to “female” and “male” respectively.

+ Now that we have renamed the factor level to “undetermined”, can you recreate the barplot such that “undetermined” is last (after “male”)?
]
